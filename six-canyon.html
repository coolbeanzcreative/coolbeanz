					<h2>background</h2>
					<p>Six Canyon Glenwood Springs is a new apartment complex in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. The atmosphere is "semi-upscale, but not too pricey, especially compared to surrounding cities. Granite counters, nice apartments, but affordable to working professionals." Brindle Digital Marketing approached me to develop their brand, along with a comprehensive set of guidelines to outline the identity's visual appearance in all applications, public perception and accessibility, all while representing the organization’s core values of transparency, trust and respect.</p>

					<h2>discovery</h2>
					<p>Being based in Toronto, far from the rocky mountains of Colorado, we conducted research on the area where the apartment complex was being built. Through watching videos and browsing images depicting Colorado's beautiful scenery, and learning more about Six Canyon's target market and company objective, we were beginning to realize the direction that we would take their brand.</p>

					<h2>concept</h2>
					<p>The branding process began with the creation of the logo. We wanted to create something that represented Colorado's nature, specifically the canyons and rivers. The Six Canyon symbol focuses on Colorado’s rocky terrain encompassed in a six-sided shape, representing a three-dimensional building. It features a modern, flat design, utilizing the negative space to highlight the canyons and river. The scenic logo creates a sense of familiarity and home, but hints at an adventure awaiting.</p>

					<h3>color palette</h3>
					<p>Color is a primary means of visual identifcation that we use to create a powerful emotional response. These colors were chosen with care to convey that Six Canyon is a vibrant, forward-looking brand. The consistent use of a limited number of colors will build strong external recognition and memorability for Six Canyon.</p>
					<h4>primary palette</h4>
					<p>The primary color is Canyon Orange, which is intended to be the main signifying color for the brand. It should be used for all solid fill secondary graphics and orange typography used on black backgrounds. Rust Red, Sky Blue and Charcoal are supporting colors, which round out our primary palette and provide a foundation for Canyon Orange to stand out.</p>
					<h4>secondary palette</h4>
					<p>The secondary palette should only be used for support in visual documents, when a greater variety of color is necessary. These colors are paler in tone and can be used to highlight the bolder and brighter primary palette colors.</p>

					<h3>typography</h3>
					<p>Six Canyon’s primary typeface is Proxima Nova. The sans-serif typeface is bold and well-suited for a wide range of visual communications. Multiple levels of typographic hierarchy are defined both for impact and clarity of communication.</p>

					<hr>
					<h3>canyon corner</h3>
					<p>Just as Colorado has many rivers that flow together, the Canyon Corner suggests confluence, a coming together of people at Six Canyon. It is sharp like a canyon, and can be used to create visual impact. A viewer should not see more than one Corner in any given application or environment. The Corner should only be used in the top left or right corner opposite from any other graphic elements near the top to create a visual balance (ie. for letterhead: logo on the left side and Corner on the right side). Appropriate examples include letterheads, business cards, brochure covers, web landing pages and trade show graphics.</p>
